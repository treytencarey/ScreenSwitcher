# ScreenSwitcher

ScreenSwitcher is a portable, easy-to-use application that allows one or more PCs to access hotkeys of another PC (via internet connection).

  - Configure your own hotkey combos.
  - Hotkeys send to connected PC, pressing corresponding hotkey.
  - Used primarily for **OBS Studio**, allowing people who stream together to both change OBS scenes and receieve audio feedback of scene changes.
  - Play any sound you want when a scene becomes active or inactive.
  - Play sounds after a configured delay (TRANSITIONPOINT in config.ini).
  - Create new sound combinations by telling what sound should play when going from what scene to what scene (PLAYSOUND in config.ini).
  - Choose whether or not your own scene switches (not triggered by someone else) should also trigger sounds to play.
  - You can now assign multiple hotkeys to the same scene. When the client(s) switch a scene, whichever hotkey for the same scene comes first is triggered.
  - Multi-client support! Allow several people to all change scenes and keep them in sync, or connect a bot (like I did with Python) to listen for scene switches!

# How to Run

  - Update your sounds and config file in the Client/Client and Server/Server directory.
  - Run the Server/Run-Release.bat on your streamer PC and the Client/Run-Release.bat on your other PC.

# New Features!

 - No more waiting for the server before opening the client!
   - Client will wait for the server before connecting automatically.
   - If client loses connection, will also try reconnecting. 
   - When client connection no longer available, server now clears the resources used by the client.
 - Client key simulation! Similar to the server, the client now simulates key presses for configured scenes. Don't want key presses? Set the first scene value to blank ("Scene=").
   - We ran into a problem sharing 2 screens at the same time where one screen's mic audio was broadcasting, and the second screen's audio was also broadcasting that mic so it was echoing. This will allow (un)muting the mic in OBS when the scenes change.

You can also:
  - Connect on any internet connection (local or remote).
  - Enable sounds to play when you change scenes yourself, or only when someone else changes the scene for you.

Configuration is easy, and examples are already provided in the config.ini files.

> IPV4=192.168.0.23\
> PORT=2322\
> // Use keycodes from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes (leave as hex value, so 0x31 from the link is 31 below).\
> // Hotkeys use '+' delimiters, so 11+31 means "press Shift and 1 at the same time". Give this action any name:\
> Game Queue=11+31\
> // Notice below that we have two of the same scene (Game - Trey).
> //   Using the same scene twice allows us to use multiple hotkeys for a scene switch.
> //   When someone else triggers a scene switch, whichever hotkey assigned FIRST is the one that is triggered on the host PC (in this case, DD which maps to key '[').
> Game - Trey=DD\
> Game - Trey=11+32\
> Game - Nate=11+33\
> // syntax: [sceneName]soundFile -> Plays the sound if the scene becomes active\
> //         [all]soundFile -> Plays the sound if the scene changes.\
> //         [sceneName]soundFile[all]otherSoundFile -> Plays soundFile if the scene becomes active, otherwise plays otherSoundFile if any other scene becomes active.\
